                    <div class="abstract">
                        The use of AI and Robotics in our society is becoming ubiquitous and inevitable across various
                        walks of life. The new generation of robots work much more closely with humans, other robots and
                        interact significantly with the environment around it. As a result, the key paradigms are
                        shifting from isolated decision making systems to one that involves shared control -- with
                        significant autonomy devolved to the robot platform; and end-users in the loop making only high
                        level decisions.<br>
                        This session will introduce powerful machine learning technologies ranging from robust
                        multi-modal sensing, shared representations, scalable real-time learning and adaptation, and
                        compliant actuation that are enabling us to reap the benefits of increased autonomy while still
                        feeling securely in control â€“ with focus on latest algorithmic and hardware developments.<br>
                        This also raises some fundamental questions: while the robots are ready to share control, what
                        is the optimal trade-off between autonomy and control that we are comfortable with?<br>
                        Domains where this debate is relevant include deployment of robots in surgical interventions,
                        extreme environments, self-driving cars, asset inspection, repair & maintenance, factories of
                        the future and assisted living technologies including exoskeletons and prosthetics to list a
                        few.

                        Endobronchial intervention is increasingly used as a minimally invasive means for the treatment
                        of pulmonary diseases. This process requires accurate pre-operative diagnosis, planning, and

                    <div class="abstract">
                        The field of soft robotics integrates robotics, biology, and material sciences to develop the
                        next generation of robots that are better suited to complex uncertain environments and
                        human-centered operations with strict safety requirements. As a core component of soft robots,
                        soft actuators have remained a consistent research focus, among which an emerging class of
                        electrostatic soft actuators stands out for their exceptional energy and power densities, as
                        well as high electromechanical efficiencies. This talk will first introduce the fundamental
                        concepts, working principles, and state-of-the-art advancements in electrostatically driven soft
                        actuators. Research progress on the design and modeling of the electrostatic soft actuators in
                        our lab over the last five years will be reported. Finally, the talk will present our efforts in
                        deploying these actuators for emerging biomedical applications (e.g. a soft crawling capsule
                        robot for endoscopies) and human-machine interaction applications (e.g. a multimodal fingertip
                        wearable device for immersive virtual reality).

                        Embodied intelligence enables intelligent agents to act autonomously in the physical
                        environment. Large-scale automated simulation optimizes robots' perception, decision-making, and
                        manipulation abilities by creating virtual environments to simulate complex scenarios and tasks.
                        In the future, simulation technology will become more efficient, but it still needs to be
                        combined with real-world data to handle more larger-scale and complex tasks.

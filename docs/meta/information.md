Professor of Robotics, University of Edinburgh and Programme Director, The Alan Turing Institute, London
Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, UK

Sethu Vijayakumar is the Professor of Robotics at the University of Edinburgh, UK, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Founding Director of the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics.  He has pioneered the use of large-scale machine learning techniques in the real-time control of several iconic robotic platforms such as the SARCOS and the HONDA ASIMO humanoids, KUKA-LWR robot arm and iLIMB prosthetic hand. One of his projects (2016) involved a collaboration with NASA Johnson Space Centre on the Valkyrie humanoid robot being prepared for unmanned robotic pre-deployment missions to Mars. Professor Vijayakumar, who has a PhD from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, holds the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) - Microsoft Research Chair at Edinburgh and is also an Adjunct Faculty of the University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles. He has published over 250 peer reviewed and highly cited articles [H-index 50, Citations > 13,000 as of 2025] on topics covering robot learning, optimal control, and real-time planning in high dimensional sensorimotor systems. He is a judge on BBC Robot Wars and winner of the 2015 Tam Dalyell Prize for excellence in engaging the public with science – including his role in the UK wide launch of the BBC micro:bit initiative (2016) for STEM education. Professor Vijayakumar helps shape and drive the national Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) agenda in his role as a Programme Director (AI) at The Alan Turing Institute, the United Kingdom’s national institute for data science and Artificial Intelligence.

Talk Title: From Automation to Autonomy: Embodied Generative AI driving the Future of Work

Abstract: The use of AI and Robotics in our society is becoming ubiquitous and inevitable across various walks of life. The new generation of robots work much more closely with humans, other robots and interact significantly with the environment around it. As a result, the key paradigms are shifting from isolated decision making systems to one that involves shared control -- with significant autonomy devolved to the robot platform; and end-users in the loop making only high level decisions. 

This session will introduce powerful machine learning technologies ranging from robust multi-modal sensing, shared representations, scalable real-time learning and adaptation, and compliant actuation that are enabling us to reap the benefits of increased autonomy while still feeling securely in control – with focus on latest algorithmic and hardware developments. 

This also raises some fundamental questions: while the robots are ready to share control, what is the optimal trade-off between autonomy and control that we are comfortable with? 

Domains where this debate is relevant include deployment of robots in surgical interventions, extreme environments, self-driving cars, asset inspection, repair & maintenance, factories of the future and assisted living technologies including exoskeletons and prosthetics to list a few.

Talk title: Towards Vision-Guided Endoluminal Surgery: Planning, Sensing and Navigation

Abstract:
Endobronchial intervention is increasingly used as a minimally invasive means for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. This process requires accurate pre-operative diagnosis, planning, and intra-operative guidance for precise treatment. In this talk, we will present our recent works on pulmonary anatomical analysis and surgical navigation driven by clinical-friendly priors.

Talk title: Electrostatic soft actuators for emerging biomedical and human-machine interaction applications

Abstract: The field of soft robotics integrates robotics, biology, and material sciences to develop the next generation of robots that are better suited to complex uncertain environments and human-centered operations with strict safety requirements. As a core component of soft robots, soft actuators have remained a consistent research focus, among which an emerging class of electrostatic soft actuators stands out for their exceptional energy and power densities, as well as high electromechanical efficiencies. This talk will first introduce the fundamental concepts, working principles, and state-of-the-art advancements in electrostatically driven soft actuators. Research progress on the design and modeling of the electrostatic soft actuators in our lab over the last five years will be reported. Finally, the talk will present our efforts in deploying these actuators for emerging biomedical applications (e.g. a soft crawling capsule robot for endoscopies) and human-machine interaction applications (e.g. a multimodal fingertip wearable device for immersive virtual reality).

Talk Title: Trends on Embodied Intelligence

Abstract:Embodied intelligence enables intelligent agents to act autonomously in the physical environment. Large-scale automated simulation optimizes robots' perception, decision-making, and manipulation abilities by creating virtual environments to simulate complex scenarios and tasks. In the future, simulation technology will become more efficient, but it still needs to be combined with real-world data to handle more larger-scale and complex tasks.
